## Andrew's Portfolio Landing Page

### Introduction

Forthcoming.

<!-- gif will show preview of my website -->
<!-- <img src="images/demo.gif?raw=true"/> --> 

### Developer notes

This website is built on GitHub Pages and runs [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild site pages, from Markdown file content and presented in the Minimal Jekyll theme.

There are 4 files to focus on:

- *README.md*: changes to this Markdown file impacts the preview shown at the following link: https://github.com/aw236/aw236.github.io
- *default.html*: this is the HTML file where I can customize the layout and content of my website, add plug-ins and Google Analytics Tags, etc.
- *index.md*: This Markdown file is useful for ordering the presentation of my work.
- *_config.yml* This YAML file is useful to manage the left-hand panel of my landing page as well as to add Google Analytics property tags & tracking IDs

#### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
