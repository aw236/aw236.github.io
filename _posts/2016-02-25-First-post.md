I am putting together a new website powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), that allows Markdown to author my posts.

Writer/hacker Tom Preston-Werner began development of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in 2008 to allow [blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html). 

Markdown, Liquid, HTML & CSS go in and static sites come out, deployable on GitHub pages. While Jekyll claims you can "get up and running in seconds," reality calls for at least an hour to get a long-term solution implemented for the less technologically incined.

I aim to produce posts with graphics created in either R or Python.
